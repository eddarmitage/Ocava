 * Provides a time based on realtime but offset and scaled based on user specification

 * This time provider can be used for modelling more or less computing (network/cpu) resources within a realtime simulation
 * as execution events can be given longer or shorter amounts of times to be computed in.
 * In realtime systems that are highly unconstrained by system resources, this time provider allows for the simulation to
