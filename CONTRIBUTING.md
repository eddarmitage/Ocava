# Development Process

Please note that this library is primarily developed on an internal, private repository.  This means that issue numbers referenced in commit messages refer to the issue numbers in the internal repository.

# Contributing
Branch, edit, push, submit a merge request.  Please squash commits on merging into master.

We would encourage users to contribute a variety of domain-independent utilities which fit into the broad theme of creating, running and using simulations.

All new code added to this project, or changes made to existing code, should be committed with tests.

Effort should be made to ensure that code added to this project is in a state where it is easy to understand and use, especially where it may use non-standard or complex patterns.
This may be achieved though example code (eg in unit tests) or javadocs. 

## Commit messages
All commits should contain a reference to the issue for which they were created.
This does mean that commits visible on the GitHub repository will contain references to internal Ocado issue tracking systems.
